    Values 

        Primitives

            Values that can be stored.

        Data Structures

            Groups of values that can be stored.

    Declarations

        let 

            Declare a value which we anticipate will change.

        const

            Declare a value which we do not anticipate will change.

        Variables

            Objects

                Denoted by { } Curly Brackets

            Arrays

                Denoted by [ ] Square Brackets

        Function

            A block of reusable code that performs a specific task.

                Parameters

                    What this function will expect.

                        Defined when we define a function. 

                            Can be REQUIRED or OPTIONAL.

    Invocations

        Object properties

            const vehicle = {
                brand: "Honda",
                model: "Civic",
            }

            Dot Notation 

                truck.brand => "Honda"

            Bracket Notation

                truck["model"] => "Civic"
        
        Array elements

            conts brands = ["Honda", "Toyota", "Nissan"]

            Bracket Notation *With index*

                brands[1] => "Toyota"
            
                brands[brands.length - 1] => "Nissan"

        Variables within scope

            Where are declared variables able to be invoked from.

        Built-in / Core objects

            Objects that are predefined for us to invoke from anywhere in our project.

        Methods

            Predefined functions that are related to some object as a property.

    Executions

        Parenthesis ()

            Functions and Methods are executed via appending a parenthesis to the end of the invocation ()

                Invocation

                    console.log

                Execution

                    console.log("Hello World");

            Arguments

                Values that we pass to a function execution. Primitives, Structures, and even other functions can be passed as an argument.

                    Declaration

                        const introduce = (name: string) => {
                            let introStr = "Hello, my name is" + " " + name;
                            console.log(introStr);
                        }

                    Execution

                        introduce("Josue") => "Hello, my name is Josue"
